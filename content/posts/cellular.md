## Concepts

- Teams delivery value
  - Value chain mapping
  - Technology
    - Increases accomplishing repetitive tasks
    - Example: 1 hour @ $15/hour x labor 1 time per day 250 days a year = $3750
    - Consumer surplus
- Teams are like cells
  - They are differentiated
  - What do cells have
    - Sensors (Concentration Gradients)
    - Effectors
    - Constraints (Metabolic)
    - Autopoiesis (New cell discovery)
  - Agential Engineering
    - Competence
    - Engineers want to do the right things
    - They need to have the signals highlighted
  - They have layers of hierarchical control
    - Multi-scale heirarchical competency architecture (Michael Levin)
    - The option set at the lower levels are bent by the upper levels
    - If they do what locally seems right, it will be correct globally.
  - They send and receive signals / messages
    - Signals from Systems (CPU, RAM)
    - Signals from Business
    - Signals from Customers / Support
  - They have boundaries
  - They are competing with eachother for resources
    - PR / FAQ
  - They hide information from others
  - They have a lifecycle
    - Created
    - Grow
    - Divide
    - Shrink
    - Die
  - They have a fitness function

## Cell changes

-
- Cells need to determine when is the right time to grow / shrink
  - Q:Do cells actually know this or do other systems decide this?
- Cells need to divide / replicate
  - Q: Who chooses this?
- Cells are born
