## Where to find candidates

In many ways I think of this as starting from the inside out. The things that you have the most control over are the people in your network and the relationships you've already built with them. You can then begin to work your way outside to other sources

- Referrals are best
  - Brainstorm the 5 best engineers in your network that would fit the job description.
  - Setup a lunch / call with them and check in on them, ask them who the 5 best engineers they know are.
- Local Market Knowledge
  - Many of the best recruiters I know are very aware of their local companies and know when a key manager has left or when a company is failing and will go after that talent.
- Local Meetup Groups
  - Helpful if your job is location specific.
  - Helpful if you have a nice office and company is willing to sponsor
- Online Communitites
  - Technology specific boards
    - djangojobs.net - Django job board
    - larajobs.com - Laravel PHP job board
    - WeWorkRemotely.com - Remote only job board
  - Discord / Slack Groups
    - Google around, join the groups, post a job, hope you don't get banned. Better if you have been a member for a while then post.
  - Facebook Groups
    - Phillipines PHP User Group
  - Github
    - Some of the best sourcing I've seen has been based on my Github and writing personalized emails to me.
    - Searching for people who are active in the community, build with technology you want to use, and referencing something that I've built in the email
- Job Aggregators / Platforms
  - ZipRecruiter
  - Indeed
  - LinkedIn
- Talent Brokers
  - These are essentially places where talent has already been gathered and you are paying a premium to skip the vetting process.
  - Upwork
  - Talend
  - Turing
  - CyberCoders
- Recruiting Agencies
  - Usually these are commission based. If opportunity cost of the time spent hiring is taken into consideration it may not actually be that expensive.
  - Robert Half

## Bottom Line

Recruiting is a lot of art and science. You need to be willing to experiment to find talent and constantly evaluate your sources for their performance quality.
