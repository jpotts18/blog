<p>In many ways I think of this as starting from the inside out. The things that you have the most control over are the people in your network and the relationships you&rsquo;ve already built with them. You can then begin to work your way outside to other sources</p>
<ul>
<li>Referrals are best
<ul>
<li>Brainstorm the 5 best engineers in your network that would fit the job description.</li>
<li>Setup a lunch / call with them and check in on them, ask them who the 5 best engineers they know are.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Local Market Knowledge
<ul>
<li>Many of the best recruiters I know are very aware of their local companies and know when a key manager has left or when a company is failing and will go after that talent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Local Meetup Groups
<ul>
<li>Helpful if your job is location specific.</li>
<li>Helpful if you have a nice office and company is willing to sponsor</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Online Communitites
<ul>
<li>Technology specific boards
<ul>
<li>djangojobs.net - Django job board</li>
<li>larajobs.com - Laravel PHP job board</li>
<li>WeWorkRemotely.com - Remote only job board</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Discord / Slack Groups
<ul>
<li>Google around, join the groups, post a job, hope you don&rsquo;t get banned. Better if you have been a member for a while then post.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Facebook Groups
<ul>
<li>Phillipines PHP User Group</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Github
<ul>
<li>Some of the best sourcing I&rsquo;ve seen has been based on my Github and writing personalized emails to me.</li>
<li>Searching for people who are active in the community, build with technology you want to use, and referencing something that I&rsquo;ve built in the email</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Job Aggregators / Platforms
<ul>
<li>ZipRecruiter</li>
<li>Indeed</li>
<li>LinkedIn</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Talent Brokers
<ul>
<li>These are essentially places where talent has already been gathered and you are paying a premium to skip the vetting process.</li>
<li>Upwork</li>
<li>Talend</li>
<li>Turing</li>
<li>CyberCoders</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Recruiting Agencies
<ul>
<li>Usually these are commission based. If opportunity cost of the time spent hiring is taken into consideration it may not actually be that expensive.</li>
<li>Robert Half</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bottom-line">Bottom Line</h2>
<p>Recruiting is a lot of art and science. You need to be willing to experiment to find talent and constantly evaluate your sources for their performance quality.</p>
